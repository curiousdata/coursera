# IBM capstone project repo
This repo serves the purpose of demonstrating curiousdata's data science skills.

It holds all labs related to a capstone project, a grand finale of a 10-course IBM Data Science specialization.

It includes every step of data-related work, starting with data collection and web scraping, and ending with creation of ML models and presentation of the findings.
